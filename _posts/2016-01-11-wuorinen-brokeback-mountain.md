description: "Few short stories have become so quickly and so deeply embedded in the American consciousness as Annie Proulx's 1997 Brokeback Mountain. First published in The New Yorker and made into a critically acclaimed 2005 movie, it now animates a starkly modernist opera by Charles Wuorinen, premiered last year at Madrid's Teatro Real."
