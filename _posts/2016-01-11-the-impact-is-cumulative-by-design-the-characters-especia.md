The impact is cumulative, by design: the characters, especially the painfully laconic Ennis del Mar (sung by bass-baritone Daniel Okulitch), spend much of the opera groping their way towards self-knowledge and open expression. When Okulitch finally gets there, in the final scenes, he gives a magnificent and deeply powerful performance, capturing all the despair and self-recrimination that makes Proulx's original story so affecting.
